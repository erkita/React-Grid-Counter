# React Grid Counter

### About
* Goal: to learn React, JavaScript, and Redux
* In a 2x2 grid, each square on the grid can be counted or not counted by clicking on the square
* The counter at the top increments or decrements to show the current numbers of the square that has been clicked to be counted
* Example: 
  * single click upper right square -> increment 1, total count 1
  * click upper right square again -> decrement 1, total count 0
